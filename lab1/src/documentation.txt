This program simulates a simple banking system where multiple threads concurrently perform random money
transfers between accounts.
Each account maintains its own balance and is protected by a dedicated mutex
(using Java’s ReentrantLock), ensuring that concurrent transfers do not cause data races or inconsistencies.

The program verifies correctness by checking that the total sum of all account balances
remains constant throughout execution.

Each Account object contains its own ReentrantLock.
When a transfer occurs between two accounts, the thread must acquire both locks before modifying their balances.
To prevent deadlocks, the tryLock() method is used with a timeout and retry mechanism.

| Mutex                              | Protected invariant                                                    | Explanation                                            |

| `Account.lock`                     | The account’s balance is only modified by one thread at a time.        | Protects `balance` field from concurrent access.       |
| Combination of two `Account.lock`s | The total of both involved accounts remains correct during a transfer. | Ensures atomic transfer of funds between two accounts. |

Invariants:
Total money across all accounts never changes.
An account’s balance is always internally consistent — it can never be modified by two threads simultaneously.
Each transfer is atomic: either the full withdrawal and deposit both happen, or neither does.
At the end of the program, all threads have finished and released their locks.
